# Ledger Importer

This is a tool to make importing csv files from banks into ledger files a little easier.


## Overview

Ledger Importer allows you to create different profiles - perhaps one per bank account. Each profile stores the field mappings from the bank's export file to the ledger transactions. It also provides some simple mapping rules to automatically map payees to accounts to automate the bookkeeping somewhat.
